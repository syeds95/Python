ML based Feature Selection
The application automatically identifies the features that drive the forecast along with their relative importance

Model Selection
The best forecast model is selected automatically out of a number of statistical and ML based models

Purposeful validation
Cross validation is used to ensure a stable model is used for generating forecasts


1 Trend & Seasonality Decomposition
Statistical models ETS, ARIMA or TBATS are used to decompose each series into Trend, Seasonality (multiple) & Residual components.
This ensures each datapoint is stationary and can be treated as independent datapoint for the subsequent ML model

2 Single ML model across hierarchies
Forecast from Step1
Forecasted Trend
Forecasted Seasonality
Add Back Trend and Seasonality
Tree Based Ensemble Model to capture non-linearity & panel effects in the stationary residual data
Forecasted Stationarity in Residuals


Developed hybrid pipeline (ETS + XGB/CatBoost) to learn both temporal and cross-sectional patterns. Integrated exogenous variables and residual signals for improved accuracy, with automated retraining, monitoring, and alerting for sustained performance.
